# Collective Commerce : Rhizomal Edition

* Commerce will become increasingly localized, p2p, and require value-driven discovery. 
* More businesses will look to online to join marketplaces where benefit & profit becomes embeded in the ecologies in which they are derived.
* Units value collective autonomy. Serve local, discovered global.
* Community managed architecture for governance matching the optimal structure of easy joins / exits from collectives formed as [rhizomes](https://www.themantle.com/philosophy/rhizome-american-translation)
* Actions that empower freedom, flexibility, direct, and one that scales without external parties.
