# Fee-based Chats

Entry to a chat is purchasable via an NFT. Mint a limited amount of NFTs per chat. Allow access only to that many. Identities must be mapped to an EOA address.

As a user I want to be able to sell access to a chat within another channel. E.g. post a sale by minting from chat interface.

Might require a wallet embedded in chat client.

Better 'about' for what chats are about.

Possible statistics.

## Examples
- [Ethereum Access Chats](https://github.com/okwme/eac-chat
- [Cabal](http://cabal.chat)

## UX/UI
- include widget like interface in cabal?
- similiar to [cabal-forked-chat](https://github.com/prm3theus/p2p-notes-discovery/blob/master/FORKED_CHATS.md) mod
