- As a user, I want to initiate a forked chat, by selecting an emoji button like âœŒ.
- Upon selection, I want to input a channel name in a field, with # of hours till (or % of people within the chat vote).
- Upon enter, I want the interface to create a clickable emoji of + / - in a a certain type of message support
- This element will have a countdown timer (or % complete ratio) to auto-initiate the new channel.

# Implementation
Code for a work in progress can be found [here](https://github.com/prm3theus/cabal-desktop) using [cabal chat](http://cabal.chat)
